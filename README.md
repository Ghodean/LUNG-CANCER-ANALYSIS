# LUNG-CANCER-ANALYSIS
Exploring Lung Cancer Risk Factors: A Data-Driven Analysis Using SQL and Python
Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest forms of cancer worldwide, responsible for millions of deaths each year. Early detection and prevention are crucial in improving survival rates, but many factors, ranging from genetics to environmental and socioeconomic influences, can affect a patient's risk. Understanding these factors can help researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals develop targeted prevention and intervention strategies.
In this study, I analysed a lung cancer dataset that includes 25 features related to demographics, environmental exposure, healthcare access, and genetic factors. The dataset contains the following key columns:
Demographics: Country, Age, Gender
Lifestyle & Environmental Factors: Smoking Status, Air Pollution Exposure, Occupation Exposure, Rural or Urban, Secondhand Smoke, Indoor Smoke Exposure, Tobacco Marketing Exposure
Healthcare & Diagnosis: Socioeconomic Status, Healthcare Access, Treatment Access, Clinical Trial Access, Insurance Coverage, Delay in Diagnosis
Genetic & Medical Information: Family History, Language Barrier, Cancer Type, Mutation Type, Stage at Diagnosis, Mortality Risk, 5-Year Survival Probability and Final Prediction.
Goal of the Analysis
The primary goal of this analysis is to determine whether any of these factors play a significant role in lung cancer diagnosis and patient survival probability. By examining correlations between smoking, air pollution, healthcare access, and genetic mutations, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that could be valuable for healthcare research and policy.
Importance of This Data in Healthcare
Data-driven healthcare analysis is essential for improving disease prevention and treatment. Large datasets like this provide opportunities to:
Identify high-risk populations based on environmental and lifestyle factors.
 Assess whether healthcare access disparities impact survival rates.
Examine the role of genetic mutations in lung cancer progression.
 Improve early detection by recognizing key indicators associated with lung cancer diagnoses.

Approach
To conduct this analysis, I used SQL for structured data retrieval and aggregation and Python for deeper statistical analysis and visualization. SQL helped me query the dataset to find distributions and correlations, while Python allowed for more advanced data exploration, including plotting trends and running statistical models.
By combining both tools, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing lung cancer cases. The following sections will summarise key findings and insights based on exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and advanced queries.
